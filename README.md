# Automatic Max Size Image
So you don't have to manually alter a URL to get a higher res version of an image.
## Supported image sites
media.tumblr.com, pbs.twimg.com, Instagram posts, ytimg thumbnails
## Usage
Plug and play. Automatic for Tumblr and Twitter. For Instagram, you must be on a post's page. Right clicking will automatically load the higher res image.
## Todo
* Make Instagram image fetching better
* Reddit support, others?
* Replace images natively (max size GIFs on Tumblr are sometimes not animated when lower res versions are)
